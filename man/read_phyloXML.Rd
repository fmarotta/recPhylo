\usage{
read_phyloXML(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A string, a connection, or a raw vector (see xml2::read_xml).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to xml2::read_xml.}
}
\value{
A list of the phylogenies that were parsed from the file.
}
\description{
Read a tree from a file in phyloXML format and parse it
into a list of phylogeny objects.
}
\note{
The \verb{<name>} of the nodes in the tree will be made unique, if necessary, by adding
suffixes of the form \verb{#1}, \verb{#2}, and so on. Unnamed clades will be given
"unnamed" as their name. This is because the functions in this package
heavily rely on the clades being uniquely named.
}
\section{Phylogeny objects}{

Each phylogeny is a list of class \code{phyloXML_phylogeny} with one field
for each attribute or child of the \verb{<phylogeny>} tag. The \code{clade} field
is a nested list structure of class \code{phyloXML_clade}, with one field
for each attribute of child of the \verb{<clade>} tag.

path_to_xml <- example_phyloXML_file()
